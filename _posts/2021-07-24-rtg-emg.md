Modern game engines are flexible, extensible, state of the art tools capable of integrating a wide variety of input types, data sources, and modeling / analysis methods to generate high fidelity imagery on a variety of hardware.

This presentation was originally developed to help raise faculty awareness of the broad applications for these tools in research, education, and enterprise. I also discuss relevant trends and opportunities, and introduce Epic's Unreal Engine and their MegaGrant program.

This material is adapted from a talk I've given a few times at Auburn and, most recently, to the folks at MGMWERX and AUiX at Air University, Maxwell AFB, Montgomery. It is based on latest industry reports and personal experience gained from over 20 years in the industry.
