The Spring 2021 semester has ended and with it my first semester as Instructor of Record for BUSI / ENGR 3510, _Introduction to Business and Engineering_. This course follows 3520, _Integrating Business and Engineering Theories with Practice_ (don't ask me why the names and numbers are in reverse order), and concludes the first year of Auburn's Business-Engineering-Technology (BET) minor.

Using 100 of more than 400 slides presented, this deck highlights the key topics I cover in the updated Spring offering. Six guest speakers, eight makerspace lab sessions, and two site visits support, extend, apply, and authenticate those lectures.

You can find a similar deck for the prior class here: [BET 3520 Fall 2020 Course Summary](https://olearydj.github.io/antisimplistic/teaching/presentation/2020/11/13/bet3520-fall2020.html)
