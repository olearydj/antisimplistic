## Bio
<img align="left" height="275" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/hello.png">

I'm Dan O'Leary, aka *Antisimplistic*, a second career Instructor, PhD Student and Researcher in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Auburn University. After 23 years in the games industry as a co-founder of the independent development studio [n-Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Space), it was past time for a change.

I currently teach undergraduate courses in Python / SQL and Product Development. The later is a 3-course sequence covering innovation, entrepreneurship, lean startup methods, and leadership in the department's [Business-Engingeering-Technology](http://www.eng.auburn.edu/research/centers/twc/bet-program/index.html) minor, offered by the [Thomas Walter Center for Technology Management](http://www.eng.auburn.edu/research/centers/twc/index.html). I am also a member of the teaching team for three graduate-level classes in Product Development and Engineering Econ / Finance.

My academic and research interests are broad, encompassing data science, simulation, and visualization. For my dissertation I am exploring the efficacy of mixed reality training methods for  workforce development in the manufacturing industry.

Until recently, I continued to support and maintain [GUNSTRUCTION](https://gunstruction.net), which I founded in 2012. From 2020 to 2021 it logged nearly 200 million user interactions across web, iOS, and Android devices. In order to focus on my transition to academics, GUNSTRUCTION was sold in the summer of 2021.
